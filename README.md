**Deep Learning Framework for Prediction of Cardiopulmonary Arrest**

The cardiopulmonary arrest is a major issue in any country. Gone are the days when it used to happen to those who are aged but now it is a major concern emerging among adolescents as well. According to the World Health Organization (WHO), cardiac arrest and stroke is still a major concern and remains a public health crisis. In past years India has witnessed many cases of heart related issues which used to occur predominantly among people having high cholesterol. But now the scenario has changed and cases were observed in people having normal cholesterol level. There are several factors involved in heart stroke such as age, sex, blood pressure etc. which are used by doctors to monitor and diagnose the same. The factors contributing to heart issues can be used as a beacon to predict the stroke and help an individual to further consult a doctor beforehand. This work focuses on different predictive models and ways to improve the accuracy of prediction by analyzing datasets on how they affect the accuracy of certain algorithm. The idea is to target the datasets and the prediction algorithms of machine learning and deep learning including advanced ones (transfer learning, LRP etc.) in order to improvise it and attain a better result.
